# Resollect Loan Dashboard

A React-based frontend application for displaying loan data with filtering and upload functionality.

## Tech Stack
- React.js
- HTML/CSS
- Git for version control

## Components
- `Sidebar.js`: Navigation menu with Resollect logo and collapsible functionality.
- `FilterSection.js`: Search, column selection, and upload button.
- `DataTable.js`: Displays loan data with filtering.
- `Pagination.js`: Basic pagination controls.
- `UploadDocument.js`: Form to upload new loan entries.

## Features
- Filter loan data by Loan No.
- Upload functionality to add new entries to the table via a form.
- Mobile-responsive design with a collapsible sidebar.
- Resollect logo in the sidebar and browser tab.
- Polished tab buttons with active state and hover effects.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm start`

## Deployment
The app is deployed on Netlify: [Live URL](#) *(Add the live URL here after deployment)*

## Notes
- The Resollect logo (`resollect-logo.jpg`) should be placed in `src/assets/` for the sidebar and in `public/` for the favicon and manifest.
- The upload functionality adds mock entries to the table. In a real application, this would likely involve an API call.# Resollect-loan-dashboard
